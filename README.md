# Ch-5-Work-Day-Schedule
Module 5 Challenge

## Description
This repo contains my solution for the Module 5 Challenge of the Full Stack Application Development course.

It is a Work day schedule calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm)
When the user clicks save on an event/time slot, a check mark and message is displayed to let the user know that event was saved to Local Storage.

    - Events that have passed are highlighted in Grey; 
    - The event that is most current based on the current time is highlighted in red;
    - And events in time slots that haven't occured yet are highlighted in Green.

The current day of the week, Date, and live clock are displayed at the top of the page.
